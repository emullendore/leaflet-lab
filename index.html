			Sulfur dioxide is a reactive gas emitted by power plants from the process of fossil fuel combustion (coal-fire). Standards for SO2 were first set by the EPA
			in 1971. <b>Respiratory effects</b> can arise from prolonged exposure to SO2. The substance is also a culprit of <b>acid rain</b>. In 1996, under the authority of the Clean Power Plan, the National Ambient Air Quality Standards were established. Standards set in 1971
			were revised in 2010. The new 1-hour standard is <b>75 parts per billion</b>.
			Symbols outlined in <b><org style="color: darkgoldenrod">orange</org></b> represent cities above this standard.</p>
			<p>
			Cities on this map are the most polluted by year-round particle pollution, as determined by the American Lung
			Association's 2015 <a href="http://www.stateoftheair.org/2015/assets/ALA_State_of_the_Air_2015.pdf">State of the Air</a>. Sulfur dioxide is one component of particular pollution.
		</p>
		<p>
			Coal-fired power plants show a strong correlation with SO2 pollution. These are  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_coal_power_stations">coal-fired
			power plants</a> with output over 2,000 MW.</p>
		<p>
			It is important to acknowledge the progress made in air pollution reduction in the past decades,
			but to also look to the future to continually improve air quality in America.
